# Grounded Canon v2 (Single-Premise)

This canon enforces a single extraordinary premise: a minority of humans can locally warp reality under emotional/attentional load. Everything else is causal, realistic, and policy/engineering driven. No metaphysical past rewrites, no deity AIs, no magic rituals.

## Single-Premise Constraints

- Prevalence: ~0.1–1% individuals exhibit measurable local effects; clusters can synchronize.
- Range/scale: meters to tens of meters; intensity decays with distance; persistence decays unless reinforced.
- Domains: geometric deformation, transient material property shifts, minor clock drift and perceptual time skew. No global retcons or spontaneous complex object creation.
- Costs: fatigue, injury risk, environmental rebound; effects relax toward baseline without reinforcement.
- Records/Memory: Only altered by human action or warped human interactions; the past isn’t rewritten.

## Continuum (Program), Not AI Entity

- Continuum is a crisis-era, multi-agency analytics and operations program (ops center + models + protocols), not a bioengineered hive mind. It forecasts risk, issues playbooks, and coordinates response. It does not think with “personalities,” nor directly manipulate reality.

## Bureau, Tech, and Public Interfaces

- The Bureau: coalition agency coordinating surveillance, clinical care, urban design, and records. Permits/forms create shared baselines and accountability; they do not mystically anchor reality.
- Tech policy: normal computing exists in operations; public displays are restricted because synchronized stimuli can amplify incidents. Outputs for public use prefer print/audio.

## Calendars and Dates

- Old Calendar (OC) and Bureau Year (BY) are both used in archived texts. For clarity:
  - OC 1702–1710 = 1965–1970 CE (ACE‑7 development)
  - OC 1775–1790 = 1975–1990 CE (ACE‑13 creation and analysis)
  - OC 1790–1791 = 1990–1991 CE (Palim construction and nuclear war)
  - Year 0 BY = 1992 CE (start of Bureau era)
  - Present setting = Year 60 BY = 2052 CE

When an OC range appears in legacy documents, it refers to the above mapping. Earlier mythic language is deprecated.

## Organizational Language

- The Bureau is the governing body.
- Ministries are top‑level directorates (e.g., Records, Permits, Infrastructure, Clinical, Communications).
- Departments are subdivisions within Ministries (e.g., Department of Temporal Consistency in Records).
- Use “Ministry” for cabinet‑level entities, “Department” for operational units.

## Technology & Interfaces

- Public layer: restricted displays to reduce synchronization risk; citizens primarily interact via paper/audio. 
- Operations: computing/surveillance/analytics in secured facilities; outputs to paper/audio for public-facing processes.
- Economy: credforms centrally ledgered; citizens use stamped scrip and permits; reconciliation in restricted facilities.

## Consciousness Metrics

- Standard Consciousness Unit (SCU): 1 SCU = capacity to alter 1 m³ for 1 hour.
  - Personal baseline: 0.1–0.3 SCU; Enhancement threshold: 1.0; Danger: 5.0; Crisis: 25.0.
- Temporal Distortion Index (TDI): 1.0 = consensus time; 0.0 = stasis; ∞ = loop.
- Pre‑Collapse exposure approached ~70% globally. Palim’s survivor population was curated/treated; most citizens today show minimal or no active manifestations.
