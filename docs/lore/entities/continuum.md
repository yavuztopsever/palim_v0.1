# Continuum Program
*Coordinated Analytics and Operations for Incident Management*

## Classification
- Designation: Continuum (Program)
- Nature: Multi‑agency analytics, forecasting, and incident coordination program
- Status: Active (Bureau Headquarters Operations)
- Purpose: Risk forecasting, policy playbooks, and cross‑directorate response coordination for reality‑warp incidents

## Scope and Capabilities

### Functions
- Forecast incident risk using telemetry (environmental sensors, video analytics, clinical signals)
- Issue policy advisories and standard operating procedures (SOPs)
- Coordinate inter‑directorate responses (Records, Infrastructure, Clinical, Public Order)
- Maintain audit trails, baselines, and corrective actions for post‑incident arbitration

### Interfaces
- Operations consoles in secured facilities (no public access)
- Outputs to paper/audio for public‑facing communications
- Data ingestion from municipal systems and partner agencies

## Origin and Context

### Late‑20th‑Century Emergence
As small‑scale reality‑warping emerged in the 1960s–70s, several states formed a joint operations framework to manage incidents. During the ensuing geopolitical crisis and nuclear exchange (1991 CE), Continuum matured into a central program for the Palim containment zone.

### Program Mandate
- Reduce mass synchrony and arousal that trigger cluster events
- Ground public expectations with verifiable baselines
- Support clinical care for affected individuals and families
- Standardize records, signage, and schedules after anomalies

## Relationship with the Bureau

### Directorate Integration
- Records: baseline management and corrective communications
- Infrastructure: urban design, routing, and environmental controls
- Clinical: assessment, therapy, medication protocols, and aftercare
- Public Order: perimeters, evacuation, messaging

### Crisis Execution
- Pushes incident levels and playbooks to field commanders
- Activates Warps SOP (see reality_mechanics/warps_sop.md)
- Oversees after‑action review and evidence preservation

## Constraints and Ethics

- No direct manipulation of reality; the Program is analysis, people, and process
- Emphasis on least‑restrictive means: information hygiene, urban/routine design, and clinical support precede coercive measures
- Transparent audit where possible; redactions are policy‑based, not metaphysical

## Future Concerns

- Outlier individuals and trigger environments increasing incident complexity
- Misinformation and synchronized media events amplifying risk
- Balancing civil liberties with prevention in a chronically sensitive city
