Note: This page adheres to Grounded Canon v2 (single-premise).
## Basic Information

**Name**: Finnegan Seamus McGrath  
**Age**: 35  
**Function**: Independent Risk Assessment Consultant  
**District**: Market Sprawl (Uncertainty Trading Exchange)  
**Consciousness Status**: Probabilistic Influence (enhanced forecasting; perception of options)  

## Appearance

Finn moves through the Market Sprawl with the careful deliberation of someone constantly calculating odds. His eyes dart between multiple futures simultaneously, occasionally stopping to stare at empty space where he observes probability threads invisible to others. He dresses in practical business attire with numerous pockets containing dice, calculators, and probability charts, tools that help him channel his consciousness effects.

His effects present as enhanced forecasting: he reports perceiving options as “branching streams,” aiding rapid odds estimation under stress. Accuracy remains high but bounded by available information and intervention costs.

## Background and History

### Early Life and Natural Intuition
Born to a family of small-time gamblers and risk-takers, Finn demonstrated an unusual ability to predict outcomes from childhood. He could sense when dice would roll favorably, predict which vendors would have the best deals, and anticipate market fluctuations hours before they occurred.

### The Enhancement Event
**Year 54**: During a massive market crash when chaos theory and random fluctuations threatened to destroy the entire Market Sprawl economy, Finn attempted to predict and prevent the economic collapse by calculating increasingly complex probability scenarios. The strain of processing thousands of variables simultaneously triggered his consciousness enhancement.

**The Manifestation**: While frantically calculating probability outcomes to prevent economic disaster, Finn began seeing multiple potential futures as visible streams of possibility. He realized he could perceive the branching paths of reality and calculate the probability of different outcomes by observing the density and flow of possibility streams.

### Current Role
Finn operates as the Market Sprawl's premier risk assessment specialist, using his probability consciousness effects to help businesses and individuals make decisions with optimal outcomes. He serves as both consultant and safeguard against random disasters that could destabilize the commercial district.

## Consciousness Abilities

### Primary Effects: Future Probability Visualization

**Option Perception (Grounded)**: Rapid option triage under uncertainty:
- Mentally maps outcomes and their dependencies (“branching streams” metaphor)
- Estimates likelihoods using cues, experience, and bounded influence
- Identifies key decision points and leverage
- Tracks how present actions shift near‑term outcome distributions

**Outcome Prediction**: Enhanced ability to predict results of complex scenarios:
- Assesses likelihood of business ventures, investments, and commercial decisions
- Predicts market fluctuations and economic trends through probability analysis
- Forecasts social and personal outcomes for relationship and career decisions
- Anticipates random events and disaster scenarios through possibility monitoring

**Risk Optimization**: Ability to identify paths that maximize favorable outcomes:
- Guides clients toward decision paths with highest success probabilities
- Identifies hidden risks and unexpected opportunities through probability analysis
- Optimizes timing for important decisions and major actions
- Coordinates complex operations by managing multiple probability variables

### Secondary Effects: Chaos Management

**Random Event Mitigation (Bounded)**:
- May slightly bias near‑field outcomes via attention and timing; effects decay
- Reduces impact of “random” disasters through preparation and micro‑choices
- Stabilizes chaotic operations by reinforcing order patterns
- Manages uncertainty by pacing and messaging to avoid crowd synchrony

**Decision Amplification**:
- Strong decisions at key points carry outsized impact
- Influences others by communicating options and confidence (no “luck fields”)
- “Favorable coincidences” reflect preparedness and small bounded effects
