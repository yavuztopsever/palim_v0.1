# Mutual Aid Cooperatives Network (MACN)
*Co‑ops that make daily life possible*

## Overview

The MACN is a federation of housing, food, water, and childcare cooperatives. Built during shortages and maintained through routine, they stabilize neighborhoods with dependable schedules and shared work. Their rituals are practical: cooking calendars, queue rotations, and “check‑in” rounds that quietly lower incident risk.

## Real‑World Parallels & Tensions

- Parallels: Rochdale co‑ops; Mondragón; wartime rationing clubs; neighborhood associations.
- Tensions: With speculators; with Bureau ration offices; with burnout among organizers; with fairness disputes.

## Ideological Currents & Fault Lines

- Mutualists (Anarchist): Horizontal governance, skill‑share economy, rotating roles.
- Social Democrats (Labor/Left): Federated co‑ops, public funding bridges, legal protections.
- Communards (Eco‑Left): Self‑sufficiency, urban agriculture, low‑energy routines.
- Faith Hospitality (Religious): Charity kitchens, shelter networks; dignity + duty.
- Neighborhood Conservatives (Order‑Local): “Take care of our own first,” skeptical of citywide redistribution.

Fault lines: Local first vs. citywide solidarity; open membership vs. vetted membership; cash assistance vs. in‑kind; burnout vs. paid staff.

## Pillars

- Routine as Anchor: Predictable chores and meal cycles reduce stress.
- Shared Reserves: Community pantries and cisterns for shocks.
- Skills Exchange: Fixers teach; learners help; everyone eats.
- Open Books: Members vote budgets and see every receipt.

## Story Hooks

- The Water Shift: Add a rooftop cistern network to a block.
- The Night Kitchen: Keep the Fog Quarter’s soup line running during a Warp.
- Ledger Day: Audit a co‑op and resolve a misallocation peacefully.
