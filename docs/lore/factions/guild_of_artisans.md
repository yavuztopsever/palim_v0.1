# Markets & Guilds Council (MGC)
*Merchants and makers balancing continuity with safety*

## Overview

The Markets & Guilds Council is a pragmatic coalition of stallholders, repair crews, stage technicians, and craftspeople. They keep commerce and culture running by adopting safe‑performance codes, sharing risk, and maintaining insurance pools for incident recovery. Their mantra: “We open tomorrow.”

## Real‑World Parallels & Tensions

- Parallels: Medieval guilds; Hanseatic League mercantile norms; modern co‑op federations; occupational safety codes.
- Tensions: With black‑market operators; with rigid inspectors; with artists who reject codes; with insurers who push risk onto workers.

## Ideological Currents & Fault Lines

- Co‑op Syndicalists (Labor/Left): Worker ownership, safety committees, solidarity pricing.
- Merchant Liberals (Market/Capital): Open trade, flexible codes, sponsor‑led recovery.
- Cartelist Oligarchs (Old‑Money): Consolidate stalls/venues, exclusive contracts; shadowy influence.
- Craft Traditionalists (Cultural‑Conservative): Heritage methods, apprenticeship rites; wary of novelty.
- Festival Libertarians (Social‑Right‑Libertarian): Anti‑regulation, “the show goes on,” conflict with safety stewards.

Fault lines: Codes vs. hype; mutual‑aid payouts vs. profit extraction; guild standards vs. innovation; venue shutdowns vs. continuity.

## What They Do

- Safety Codes: Lighting/sound/practice standards for venues and stalls.
- Mutual Aid: Micro‑grants, tool libraries, and shared storage.
- Recovery Pools: Fast payouts after incidents to reopen within days.
- Training: Short courses in de‑escalation and crowd pacing.

## Organization

- District Chambers: Docklands Freight, Market Stalls, Theater Techs, Fog Repairs.
- Arbitration Boards: Resolve disputes quickly with Archives observers.
- Logistics Wing: Backup inventory and mobile storefronts for continuity.

## Stance

- Pro‑Transparency: Prices, practices, and incidents logged and shared.
- Pro‑Adaptation: Design‑first fixes with Flow Architects.
- Pro‑Dignity: No spectacle; no exploitation of outliers for profit.

## Story Hooks

- The Safety Ledger: Implement codes in a notorious venue before the big show.
- Rolling Market: Deploy mobile stalls after a district Warp; keep income flowing.
- Arbitration Night: Settle a price dispute that risks escalating a crowd.
