# Civil Harm‑Reduction League (CHRL)
*Clinicians, social workers, and neighbors practicing least‑restrictive care*

## Overview

The Civil Harm‑Reduction League is a citywide network of clinicians, counselors, and volunteers who treat warping as a public‑health challenge rather than a crime. They staff calm rooms, mobile de‑escalation teams, and after‑incident support circles. Their north star: fewer injuries, fewer detentions, more people sleeping safely at home.

## Real‑World Parallels & Tensions

- Parallels: Harm reduction (Portugal drug policy); CAHOOTS and crisis response teams; Médecins Sans Frontières fieldwork ethics.
- Tensions: With security services seeking detentions; with sensational media; with underground thrill‑seekers; with clinicians’ burnout and funding.

## Ideological Currents & Fault Lines

- Public‑Health Socialists (Labor/Left): Universal clinics, guaranteed rest, paid recovery; push for systemic resourcing.
- Faith‑Based Caritas (Religious/Spiritual): Congregation‑run calm rooms, pastoral care; emphasize dignity and forgiveness.
- Radical Medics (Anarchist Mutual Aid): Street‑level care, minimal bureaucracy; suspicion of institutional capture.
- Liberal Reformers (Civic‑Centrist): Pilot programs, evidence‑based rollouts, public‑private partnerships.
- Population Security (Order‑First Minority): Argue for limited mandatory holds in extreme cases; constant friction with core.

Fault lines: Voluntary care vs. compulsory stabilization; data transparency vs. privacy; clinic scale‑up vs. burnout; partnering with Bureau vs. independence.

## Principles

- Care First: Voluntary supports before coercion.
- In the Open: Normal life with accommodations beats hiding.
- Community Capacity: Train neighbors to notice and de‑escalate early.
- Evidence & Ethics: Track outcomes; publish; accept review.

## Services

- Calm Rooms: Low‑trigger spaces with lighting, sound, and weighted furnishings.
- Mobile Teams: Pair a clinician, a steward, and a driver; respond within minutes.
- Stabilization Plans: Sleep, meds if needed, workload changes, buddy systems.
- Post‑Incident Circles: Reconcile accounts, repair harm, set practical next steps.

## Organization

- District Clinics: Docklands (shift workers), Theater (performance stress), Market (tempo pressure), Fog (chronic hardship).
- Training Wing: Short courses for merchants, guards, and ushers.
- Data Desk: Anonymous outcomes, shared with Archives and Continuum Program.

## Tensions

- With hardliners: Accused of “coddling”; CHRL answers with results.
- With underground thrill‑groups: Draws a red line at risk to bystanders.

## Story Hooks

- The Night Tour: Ride along on mobile calls during a festival weekend.
- A Quiet Crowd: Train stewards for a risky plaza and measure the impact.
- The Appeals Board: Present outcomes that overturn a detention policy.
