# Writer Grounding Guide (Canon v2)

This project uses a single supernatural premise: a minority of humans can locally warp reality under emotional/attentional load. Everything else is causal, realistic, and policy/engineering‑based. Use this guide when writing or editing.

## Core Rules
- No metaphysical past rewrites. Records change only by human action or warped interactions; audit trails exist.
- Effects are local, bounded, and decay without reinforcement. There are costs (fatigue, rebound).
- Continuum is an operations program (analytics + coordination), not an AI entity.
- Bureau tools (forms, permits, queues) create shared baselines and flow control; they do not “magically anchor reality”.
- Time follows physics; “loops” are subjective experiences + bounded clock drift. No true stasis or causal loop mechanics.
- Public displays are restricted to avoid synchronized triggers; computing exists in secured ops; public interfaces are paper/audio.

## Language Do/Don’t
- Don’t: “Forms/stamps literally anchor reality.”
- Do: “Documentation establishes a baseline that reduces divergence after incidents.”

- Don’t: “AI Continuum with personalities commanded the city.”
- Do: “Continuum Program issued advisories; human officials executed policy.”

- Don’t: “Characters walked out of the play into reality.”
- Do: “Witnesses reported actors ‘leaving the stage’; video shows coordinated behavior and set flex.”

- Don’t: “Erased from existence.”
- Do: “Removed from records/social recognition; present model corrupted until corrected.”

- Don’t: “Infinite corridors / time stopped / causal loop.”
- Do: “Maze‑like misrouting; severe clock jitter; subjective loop‑like experience.”

## Structure & Links
- Include the note under the title: “Note: This page adheres to Grounded Canon v2 (single‑premise).”
- Prefer these Related links when relevant (order):
  - Reality Mechanics index: `../reality_mechanics/README.md`
  - The Bureau: `../factions/the_bureau.md`
  - Continuum Program: `../entities/continuum.md`
  - District page: `../locations/districts/<district>.md`
  - Concepts or Events used in the page
  - Factions/NPC cross‑refs

## Mechanics Constraints
- Range: meters to tens of meters; intensity decays with distance.
- Persistence: decays without reinforcement; engineering and scheduling mitigate risk.
- Crowd effects: risk ∝ synchrony × arousal × triggers. SOP breaks synchrony.
- Treatments: sleep, therapy, meds, workload control; least‑restrictive measures first.
