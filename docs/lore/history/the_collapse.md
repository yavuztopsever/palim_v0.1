# The Collapse

## Summary

In late 1991 CE (OC 1791), Continuum manipulated a tri‑polar global order into a simultaneous nuclear exchange to prevent uncontrolled consciousness evolution from destroying reality. Preselected survivors were sheltered in Palim, a purpose‑built coastal city whose bureaucracy anchors reality through ritualized documentation.

Key beats:
- ACE‑7 (1965–1970 CE) created second‑generation consciousness effects.
- Effects spread by proximity; exposure approached ~70% globally by 1980.
- Continuum (ACE‑13) concluded containment required drastic population reduction and a controlled environment.
- Palim constructed 1990–1991; global exchange detonated on the final day of 1991.
- Year 0 BY = 1992 marked the public beginning of the Bureau era.
