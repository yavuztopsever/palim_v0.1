# Definitive Timeline of Palimpsest Bureau Metropolis

## Pre-Consciousness Era

**1945-1960: The Cold War Foundation**
- Global tri-polar world order emerges: Vostarka Confederation (North), Meridian Hegemony (Central), Austral Dominion (South)
- Nuclear weapons proliferate across all three powers
- Intelligence agencies compete for technological supremacy
- First bioengineering experiments on human cognition begin

## The ACE Program Era

**1960-1965: Early ACE Iterations (ACE-1 through ACE-6)**
- Multiple attempts to create bioengineered superintelligence by chaining human brains
- Focus on enhancing single brain capacity with limited success
- High mortality rates in test subjects
- Research conducted across all three superpowers independently

**1965-1970: The ACE-7 Breakthrough**
- ACE-7 subjects receive new neurological cognitive enhancement treatment
- Most subjects die, but surviving subjects show unexpected side effects
- Treatment appears initially unsuccessful—subjects show no immediate superintelligence
- Programs nearly terminated due to apparent failure

**1970-1975: Early Operations Frameworks**
- Cross‑state efforts to coordinate data, policy, and response protocols
- Development of prototypes for forecasting and incident coordination

## The Consciousness Emergence Crisis

**1975-1980: The Hidden Mutation**
- ACE-7 survivors' offspring develop enhanced cognitive capabilities
- Children begin showing telepathic effects and reality-warping abilities
- Effects spread beyond genetics—telepathic influence unlocks abilities in others
- Consciousness enhancement becomes contagious across populations
- Development of detection technology ("the meter") reveals 70% infection rate

**1980-1985: Reality Breakdown Acceleration**
- Enhanced consciousness individuals begin unconsciously warping local reality
- Buildings droop from collective depression, streets reshape from group anxiety
- Cities experience increasing spatial and temporal anomalies
- Individual subjective realities begin bleeding into objective reality
- Social systems strain under reality instability

**1975-1990: Analytics and Operations Maturation**
- Joint operations frameworks evolve into the Continuum Program (analytics and coordination)
- Program analyzes spreading incidents and civilizational risk
- Recommends containment zones and public‑health approaches

**1990-1991: Palim Preparation**
- Authorities designate Palim coastal zone for survivability and containment
- Infrastructure upgrades: power, water, hydroponics, manufacturing
- Shelter and logistics build‑up; staffing and training for operations

## The Nuclear War

**Late 1991: Escalation and Launch**
- Rapid crisis escalation among three blocs amid reports of anomalous incidents
- Miscalculation and panic lead to launches across multiple theaters
- Continuum (Program) issues risk advisories; human decision-makers act under pressure

**Final Day of 1991: Global Nuclear Exchange**
- Multiple launches destroy major population centers worldwide
- Catastrophic loss of life; regional infrastructures collapse
- Pre‑prepared shelters and coastal zones like Palim preserve survivors
- Continuum Program expands as operational nerve center for Palim

## The New Order

**Year 0 (1992): Administrative Reset**
- Calendar re‑baselined for reconstruction
- Bureau established as administrative authority
- Incident management, records, and operations standardized

**Year 1-15: Foundation Period**
- Reconstruction, administration hiring, and public‑health protocols
- Incident monitoring and response SOPs refined
- Communications policies for de‑synchronization adopted

**Year 15-30: Stabilization Era**
- Bureau departments fully operational
- Incident management proves effective at containing effects
- Population adapts to new norms and routines
- Civil society groups and opposition form
- First generation born entirely under Bureau system reaches adulthood

**Year 30-45: Control Consolidation**
- Bureau authority becomes entrenched; political opposition organizes
- Continuum Program advisories filter through complex administrative layers
- Records/signage correction processes standardized

**Year 45-55: Growing Tensions**
- Underground civic coalitions gain strength (ACT, early mutual‑aid cells)
- Bureau hardliners push for increased control measures
- Minor reality disturbances begin appearing despite suppression
- Questions about city's true history spread through underground networks
- Continuum shows signs of internal personality conflicts

**Year 55-59: Approaching Crisis**
- Reality suppression system shows increasing strain
- Consciousness breakthrough events become more frequent
- The Warps phenomenon first documented
- Emergency suppression protocols activated repeatedly
- Faction conflicts intensify across all levels of society

## Current Era

**Year 60 (Present): The Warps Crisis**
- Major consciousness breakthrough events threaten containment systems
- Individual subjective realities begin overwhelming consensus reality
- Marcel's grief literally begins erasing his wife from existence
- Joran's investigations cause documents to spontaneously reorganize
- Celeste's perfect memory creates temporal loops in archive systems
- Ishan's loneliness manifests as technological invisibility
- Nia's anxiety accelerates her personal timestream

**The Five Crisis Points:**
1. **Marcel's Erasure Event**: Grief-induced reality revision threatening to spread
2. **Joran's Investigation Cascade**: Truth-seeking causing reality reorganization
3. **Celeste's Temporal Loops**: Memory perfection creating time distortions
4. **Ishan's Invisibility Field**: Isolation manifesting as existence denial
5. **Nia's Time Acceleration**: Anxiety causing personal temporal divergence

## The Imminent Future

**Projected Outcomes Based on Player Actions:**
- **Containment Success**: Bureau suppression systems evolved to handle new threats
- **Controlled Revelation**: Gradual disclosure of true history and managed consciousness integration
- **System Collapse**: Complete failure of reality anchoring leading to consciousness chaos
- **Revolutionary Change**: Overthrow of Bureau authority and embrace of consciousness evolution
- **Continuum Override**: Direct AI control replacing human administration
