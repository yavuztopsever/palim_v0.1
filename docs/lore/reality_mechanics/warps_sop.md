# Warps SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)

## Overview
Operational playbook for identifying, isolating, and stabilizing Warp events.

## Detection and Classification
- Meter deployment: 1 per 50m grid; Red > 5.0 SCU triggers Level 3.
- Temporal drift: TDI outside 0.5–2.0 escalates to Temporal Consistency.
- Phenomenology: spatial recursion, identity variance, loop formation.

## Escalation Ladder
- Level 1: Advisory, increase routine anchoring (queues, stamps).
- Level 2: Perimeter forms flooding; dampening fields; targeted counseling.
- Level 3: Quarantine gates, memory tonics, grid rerouting of tube network.
- Level 4: Deep Anchor protocol (citywide reset authority required).

## Ritual Anchoring Protocols
- Synchronized signatures (Form 47 series) at cardinal points.
- Queue braiding through affected streets to distribute attention load.
- Public timepiece synchronization on the quarter hour.

## Inter‑Department Coordination
- Records: authorize edits and archive snapshots.
- Temporal Consistency: time isolation and TDI normalization.
- Infrastructure: power/water reroute; tube reconfiguration.
- Public Order: perimeter and evacuation routes.

## Counter‑Subversion
- Detect forged forms (ink spectra and stamp cadence audits).
- False‑memory evacuation briefings for evacuees.
- Monitor scrip exchanges for panic signals.
