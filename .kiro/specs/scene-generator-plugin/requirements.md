# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Scene Generator Plugin for Godot that creates procedural 3D isometric environments for animated characters. The plugin will generate various game locations including rooms, outdoor areas, streets, town centers, and other environments using rule-based generation techniques. The focus is on creating a powerful yet simple tool that generates game-ready scenes without over-engineering.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to generate 3D isometric scenes through a Godot editor plugin, so that I can quickly create diverse environments for my animated characters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is installed THEN it SHALL appear as a dock panel in the Godot editor
2. WHEN I select scene parameters (type, theme, size) THEN the plugin SHALL generate a complete 3D scene
3. WHEN generation is complete THEN the scene SHALL be ready for animated character placement and navigation
4. WHEN I generate a scene THEN it SHALL use orthographic camera setup optimized for isometric view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a level designer, I want to generate different types of architectural layouts, so that I can create varied functional spaces for gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select "residential" area type THEN the system SHALL generate room layouts suitable for living spaces
2. WHEN I select "commercial" area type THEN the system SHALL generate open areas with counters and display spaces
3. WHEN I select "administrative" area type THEN the system SHALL generate office-like layouts with desks and meeting areas
4. WHEN I toggle interior spaces THEN the system SHALL generate enclosed rooms vs open outdoor areas
5. WHEN I adjust size parameters THEN the generated layout SHALL scale appropriately while maintaining functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want generated scenes to have proper collision detection and navigation meshes, so that animated characters can move through the environment correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scene is generated THEN all static geometry SHALL have StaticBody3D nodes with appropriate collision shapes
2. WHEN a scene is generated THEN it SHALL include a NavigationRegion3D with baked navigation mesh
3. WHEN characters are placed in the scene THEN they SHALL be able to navigate around obstacles using the navigation mesh
4. WHEN walls or barriers are generated THEN they SHALL properly block character movement
5. WHEN floors are generated THEN they SHALL provide walkable surfaces for characters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an artist, I want generated scenes to use modular assets that fit together perfectly, so that the environments look cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are placed THEN they SHALL align to a consistent grid system with no gaps or overlaps
2. WHEN walls meet floors THEN they SHALL connect seamlessly without visual artifacts
3. WHEN modular pieces are used THEN they SHALL maintain consistent scale and proportions
4. WHEN different asset types are combined THEN they SHALL follow the same art style guidelines
5. WHEN scenes are viewed from isometric camera THEN all elements SHALL be clearly visible and well-composed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want generated scenes to include appropriate furniture and props, so that the spaces feel functional and lived-in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN residential areas are generated THEN they SHALL include appropriate furniture like beds, tables, and storage
2. WHEN commercial areas are generated THEN they SHALL include counters, displays, and customer seating
3. WHEN administrative areas are generated THEN they SHALL include desks, filing cabinets, and meeting furniture
4. WHEN props are placed THEN they SHALL not block navigation paths or doorways
5. WHEN furniture is added THEN it SHALL be appropriately scaled and positioned for the space

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a level designer, I want to use rule-based generation parameters, so that I can control the output without manually placing every object.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify generation rules THEN the system SHALL apply them consistently across the scene
2. WHEN I set density parameters THEN the generator SHALL place appropriate amounts of props and details
3. WHEN I define layout constraints THEN the generator SHALL respect spatial relationships and logical placement
4. WHEN I use the same seed value THEN the generator SHALL produce identical results for reproducibility
5. WHEN I adjust rule parameters THEN I SHALL be able to preview changes before final generation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want generated scenes to have proper lighting setup, so that they look visually appealing and support dynamic lighting effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scene is generated THEN it SHALL include a WorldEnvironment node with appropriate settings
2. WHEN indoor scenes are created THEN they SHALL have artificial lighting sources (lamps, torches, etc.)
3. WHEN outdoor scenes are created THEN they SHALL have directional lighting simulating sunlight
4. WHEN SDFGI is available THEN the system SHALL configure global illumination for realistic light bouncing
5. WHEN lighting is applied THEN it SHALL enhance the isometric view without creating visual confusion

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want generated scenes to work seamlessly with existing camera and wall hiding systems, so that the isometric view functions properly with interior spaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN walls are generated THEN they SHALL automatically include wall hiding components compatible with existing systems
2. WHEN the camera looks into interior spaces THEN front-facing walls SHALL become transparent or hidden
3. WHEN interior spaces are generated THEN they SHALL NOT include roofs to maintain clear isometric visibility
4. WHEN wall hiding is active THEN collision detection and navigation SHALL remain functional
5. WHEN rooms are generated THEN they SHALL be properly detected as interior spaces for camera occlusion
6. WHEN generated scenes are used THEN they SHALL perform identically to hand-built scenes with camera systems

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the plugin to be self-contained within Godot, so that I don't need external dependencies or complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is installed THEN it SHALL work entirely within Godot without external tools
2. WHEN generating scenes THEN all assets SHALL be created using Godot's built-in systems
3. WHEN the plugin runs THEN it SHALL use only GDScript and Godot's native APIs
4. WHEN scenes are generated THEN they SHALL be standard Godot scene files that can be saved and edited normally
5. WHEN the plugin is distributed THEN it SHALL be a single addon folder that can be dropped into any project
