# Character Configurations

Store authored `CharacterConfig` resources in this folder. Suggested naming pattern:

- `player_config.tres`
- `merchant_guard_config.tres`
- `town_guard_config.tres`

Keeping configs together makes it easier for designers to locate reusable presets and for scripts to load them with predictable paths.
